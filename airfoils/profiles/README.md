The airfoil profile coordinate should follow the UIUC dataset standard, i.e., the airfoil coordinate starts from the trailing edge (x=1) and goes towards the leading edge (x=0) in the counter-clock direction and eventually ends at the trailing edge. It can be either a close loop or an open loop (e.g., truncated trailing edge). But there should not be duplicated coordinate points in the profile. The range of the first coordinate (streamwise direction) should be between 0 and 1.
